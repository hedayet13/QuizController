# Quiz Controller

Welcome to the Quiz Controller setup guide! Follow the steps below to get everything up and running.

To run the quiz controller, execute the `main.py` script. This script will handle the logic for your quiz event.

### GPIO Pin Setup
First, let's configure the GPIO pins. Below are the pins you'll need to use:

```
Team1 = 11
Team2 = 12
Team3 = 13
Team4 = 15
Team5 = 16
Team6 = 18
reset = 22
buzzer= 24
```
Make sure to set the GPIO pins according to the schematic view of the Raspberry Pi:

### Images from the Event
Here are some snapshots from a recent event where the quiz controller was used. Notice that the team names are positioned in the corner of the giant screen:

Additionally, there's a low voltage warning displayed on the Raspberry Pi. This is something we'll need to address:

### Bugs to be Fixed
Here are a few issues we've identified that need fixing:
- [x] Timing issue: This has been resolved.
- [ ] Fix the placement of the team name on the giant screen: The team names should be more prominently displayed.
- [ ] Resolve the low voltage warning: Ensure the Raspberry Pi has a stable power supply.

### Manufacturing Images
Finally, here are some images from the manufacturing process of the quiz controller setup. These provide a behind-the-scenes look at the assembly:
